# fyp-upload
IMPORTANT: this project was initially on a university-owned gitlab which I no longer have access to. 
the project was also too large to put on github. there is a link to a Google Drive folder where containing the code directories below:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DXCayUWZ0Bt_ac-GdSa_-ST8_mEkDVld?usp=drive_link

the code directories are unchanged from the gitlab upload, hence the .git folder etc; see the readme within the drive folder for information on
running the code/generating an output.

on this github repo you can find the technical report for the project. in particular, the method section details the major classes and methods used.

it's admittedly a little jumbled in those directories so feel free to email me any enquiries at alex181200@gmail.com 


note: the project report names the author as 'Alex Smith' - this *is* me but it's my deadname, so maybe pretend you didn't read it~
cheers, Alicia Smith
